# Symme*tree*

An AVL Tree Implementation in Kotlin.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Features:
- <b>Balanced Tree Structure</b>: Ensures that the tree remains balanced after every insertion or deletion.
- <b>Thread-safety</b>: Allows concurrent adds, removals, and iteration
- <b>Traversal Iterators</b>: Implements various tree traversal methods including InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder, and ReverseOrder.
